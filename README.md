# SQL-Catch-The-Fish-Game



Introduction

The project’s goal is to build a script for a computer game named "Catch the Fish".
The database includes the following processes:
•	Registration
•	Login
•	The actual game
•	Score management
•	Technical support
This document describes the system’s architecture and the working assumptions we have created and followed by.
The database includes tables, functions, views, and procedures.


Tables

This chapter describes all the tables in the project.
Note: Some of the tables we have created include only one column and one row, and their sole purpose is to include a text we wanted to print by running a procedure.
